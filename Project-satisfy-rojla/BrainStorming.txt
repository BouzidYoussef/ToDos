So am staring with a small part of js
Now trying to struggle thro some lectures again "from zero to hero"...whatever
just started with HTML easiest piece of cake, but the cake ain't going for you PEDOPHILE!
Shit here we go back again to js
That jquerry is a son of a *****
Here comes the son of a *****'s brother ... obviously we'r talking about CSS
Wallah HTML is the friend of mother nature!!!
And for the memory of this moment... Udemy courses are actually easy and gucci 
Now am leaving the appartment let's just hope that am not going to be a disapointment to my broken self 
YOUSSEF ENOUGH OF THE GOD DAMN CAFFEINE AND YOU'VE SMOKED ENOUGH
